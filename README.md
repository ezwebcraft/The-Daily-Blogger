# Notes from the pipenv site

**

The problems that Pipenv seeks to solve are multi-faceted:

You no longer need to use pip and virtualenv separately. They work together.
Managing a requirements.txt file can be problematic, so Pipenv uses Pipfile and
Pipfile.lock to separate abstract dependency declarations from the last tested
combination.
Hashes are used everywhere, always. Security. Automatically expose security
vulnerabilities.
Strongly encourage the use of the latest versions of dependencies to minimize
security risks arising from outdated components.
Give you insight into your dependency graph (e.g. $ pipenv graph).
Streamline development workflow by loading .env files.
